# Haralds Adventure
This is the first game I've ever created in the Godot engine. It was more meant to be a test than a actual game, but it's kinda fun and playable. More information can be found on the [itch.io page here](https://ratzifutzi.itch.io/harald). **This project is terminated and won't receive anymore updates.**
